# 🛠️ Local development

To start running the Flashcard App locally, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [docker with docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A bash terminal of your choice (Windows requires Ubuntu bash via WSL)

Clone the project to your machine, and run `./Taskfile init` to set up the project locally. Then run `./Taskfile` to see
all available commands for more local development tasks.

The application should be running locally at [https://flashcard-app.local](https://flashcard-app.local)
